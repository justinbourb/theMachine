This is a clone of the Armory & Machine mobile app, recreated as a javascript web app.

You can view a live demo here: https://tin-random.glitch.me/
This project is a WIP and the previous link may lead to a page under development.

Fancy bits:
1) Written entirely in javascript - no frameworks.
2) The only javascript library in use is countUp.js, other features are built by hand.
2) Templating
3) Routing
4) DRY code base
5) Testing
6) Event delegation
7) It uses window.addEventListener('beforeunload') to record the time the page/game was left.  Resources continue to accumulate in real time (as calculated when the game is reopened).
8) Contains at least one example of functional programming
